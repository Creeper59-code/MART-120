Last Lecture Thoughts
        After listening to the Last Lecture, a few ideas stuck with me. The first cool part of this lecture is how the speaker achieved most of his childhood dreams. This was really inspiring and will help me continue down the path I have chosen to reach my own dreams. It was also important for me to hear that giving up is the worst thing someone can do. Because the speaker didn’t give up, he found ways to work around the hurdles in front of him to become an imagineer all the way to experiencing zero gravity. The second idea that stuck out was head fakes. I always thought it was weird to play games in school to learn but now it makes picture perfect sense. I, in the future, might utilize this idea to help teach young people in the future. The coolest part of the lecture was hearing about how creative his class was. In the Building a Virtual World class, the speaker was blown away by how creative his students were when creating their virtual worlds. To see how creative the kids were showed me the things I could do in the future. All in all, the Last Lecture was very inspiring.
