Learning Styles
        Learning styles affect many people and how they learn. For example, I would consider myself a tactile learner. I learn math easier when I am able to do an example problem alongside the teacher during notes. When I miss class, it is harder to learn math with just notes and a book. My brother, on the other hand, is an auditory learner. He does better when he listens to a lesson compared to writing down notes. Because of this, he also finds it hard to learn without someone’s voice. In my opinion, most people are a mix of learning types but may be more proficient one way compared to another. I don’t know any visual learners but what I do know is they learn by watching or reading. I usually think I am a visual learner, too. Other things that hint to my learning styles include reading, taking notes, following step by step, and getting a feel for something. Ultimately, All people are more proficient in other learning styles but are mixed among them nonetheless.
